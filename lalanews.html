											<p>
							23 years ago began this story of the Lala Foundation of Ciudad Guayana<br>
			
							It started as a natural mandate of social conscience, when no Law or decree imposed it as corporate social responsibility and it was neither the first nor the only one. Already the country knew them and the most needy enjoyed their benefits in different areas of social, cultural and sports assistance and it was in 2007 when they took legal status, hand in hand with its president, Dr. Marisol Vergara.<br>
						
							His motivation of yesterday and today, is that of teamwork and the development of tactics for the preservation and improvement of health, accompanied by days of instruction, civic, cultural, medical-pharmacological and sports.<br>
						
							With this provision focused on social service, the Lala Foundation is proud to offer Guayana the "Lala Pediatric Center", the Golden Age Inn for the Elderly, the Trapichito Community Center and a music school in the same pediatric, all at a cost of solidarity for the public, visited by the pioneers of contemporary journalism in Guayana, in the midst of their admiration and logical rejoicing, as they are living witnesses of the evolution of this city of only 60 years.<br>
						
							It is not for less, because in the Lala Pediatric Center, opened in 2014, with 1,800 square meters of infrastructure, they could assess the disposition of various medical specialties, two operating theaters and, in parallel, areas for the psychological and emotional help of families with patients whose diagnoses, are not the most favorable.<br>
