			<span class="bold">Lala Foundation USA</span> <br>  
			The project is about creating a website for a Venezuelan as well as American non-governmental charity called Lala Foundation USA. The charity is already trying to do a pretty noble job that appeals to their audience, which lifts the pressure off the website's structural design to lure in the visitors. Also, the charity already has an existing website, which means it won't be necessary to recreate most of the content for the new website. <br>
			The project's main drivers include elegant and responsive designs, and what we are trying to achieve is creating a website that appeals to the beneficiaries of the charity, encourages visitors to donate, and a website that grows in popularity with the search engines. <br>

				<span class="bold">Crisis in Venezuela</span>  <br>
				A socioeconomic and political crisis that began in Venezuela during the presidency of Hugo Chávez, has continued into the presidency of Nicolás Maduro. It is marked by hyperinflation, climbing hunger, disease, crime and death rates, and massive emigration from the country. The situation is the worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history, and among the worst in the world since 2014.
